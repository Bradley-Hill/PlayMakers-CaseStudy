Playmakers Case Study - Exercise with functions for uploading a Badge

## The exercise

### We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle.

1. Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:
2. Size = 512x512
3. That only non transparent pixels are within a circle
4. That the colors is the badge give a "happy" feeling
5. Additionally, you can create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.

## Initial Planning

So my first thoughts are to start thusly :

- Set-up environment ( Going to be using TypeScript and (hopefully) some useful libraries )
- Researching useful libraries for image manipulation/verification
- Researching useful libraries for color analysis
- Breakdown functions into basic elements
- Test Driven Development
